# EkamNet Scientific Debt Register
## DP / EKAMNET RESEARCH PROGRAM

This register tracks "what remains unknown or unverified" in the substrate. It outlines the specific scientific and methodological debts that prevent strengthening empirical claims or block future milestones, serving as a permanent guide for research governance.

## 1. Active Scientific Debt Ledger

| ID | Scientific Debt | Description | Blocked Claims / Milestones | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SD-001** | **Candidate F Lineage Substitution Reconciliation** `[CLEARED]` | Historically, fixing prompt layout defects altered content hashes, rendering pre-registered lineage IDs unreachable and requiring hardcoded hex targets. Severed identity from text content hashes and introduced deterministic Structural Identity (`{day}:{stage}:{ordinal}`). Content hashes are retained on objects for integrity/dedup. | Resolved via PROMPT R2. Verified by `tests/test_structural_identity.py` (matched replication test), `EVD-004` in `EKAMNET_EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md`, and `DEC-008` in `EKAMNET_DECISION_LEDGER.md`. | Cleared: Structural Identity (`{day}:{stage}:{ordinal}`) adopted;Candidate F targeting migrated to structural ID (`1:theory:0`); hardcoded hex targets retired. |

| **SD-002** | **Live Validation Loop Target Boundary** | During live simulation, the lookahead target step `t+1` is in the future relative to the daily slice, meaning live validation records default to `UNTRIGGERED` or `TRIGGERED` (pending). Terminal states (`SUPPORTED`, `CONTRADICTED`) are only observable retrospectively. | Milestone 10 (Belief Update Engine cannot retrieve resolved terminal states during the current day's execution and must wait for subsequent step progression). | Design a retrospective evaluation buffer in the Milestone 10 orchestrator that pulls and resolves pending `TRIGGERED` records from step `t-1` as day `t` executes. |
| **SD-003** | **Cross-Regime Validation Coverage** | Replay executions are bounded to a single symbol (`RELIANCE`) over short horizons (10-30 days), which doesn't capture a broad spectrum of regime classes and market conditions. | Generalization claims (L5 verification) and system-wide lifecycle validation. | Execute longer simulation horizons (60-120 days) across indices (Nifty, Energy) and varying volatility regimes. |
| **SD-004** | **LLM Variable Hallucination (Compiler Leakage)** | Llama3.2 compiles theories containing variables that do not exist in the raw dataframe columns (e.g., `volatility_regime` and `liquidity_absorption_rate`), causing KeyErrors during validation engine checks and defaulting records to `GROUNDED`. | Clean/efficient validation coverage and noise reduction in learning. | Introduce a compiler-level ontology check or restrict prompt context to force LLM compilation to adhere to the whitelisted feature set. |
| **SD-005** | **Partially Supported Logic Constraints** | The current `ValidationEngine` evaluates atomic target conditions and only resolves binary states (`SUPPORTED` vs `CONTRADICTED`), lacking logic to compute `PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED` outcomes. | Multi-factor proposition validation (evaluating compound target definitions where some conditions are met and others fail). | Extend the `ValidationEngine` to parse compound target conditions (using AND/OR operators) and compute fractional support scores. |
| **SD-006** | **Bypassed Scientific Validation Gates** `[CLEARED]` | Historically, Milestone 5, 6, and 7 completion gates were hardcoded to `PASS`. Removed all hardcoded `PASS` literals from `verify_scientific_closures.py`, pre-registered MME thresholds in `config/cognition.yaml`, and dynamically evaluate honest verdicts (`PASS | FAIL | INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE`). | Resolved via PROMPT R3. Verified by `tests/test_closure_gates.py`, `EVD-005` in `EKAMNET_EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md`, and `DEC-009` in `EKAMNET_DECISION_LEDGER.md`. | Cleared: Pre-registered MME thresholds in `config/cognition.yaml`; hardcoded PASS literals eliminated; honest gate verdicts committed & reflected in program state. |

| **SD-007** | **Zero Resolved Evidence Accumulation in Market Replay** `[CLEARED]` | Historically, market replay accumulated zero evidence (all posteriors at Beta prior 0.50) due to plumbing gaps: `ValidationRecord` terminal states (`SUPPORTED`/`CONTRADICTED`) were not delivered to `ScoredConfidenceEngine.evolve()`, and offline compiler fallbacks lacked canonical proposition structure. | Resolved via PROMPT C2. Instrumented `telemetry/evidence_funnel.py`, wired `ValidationRecord` terminal outcomes to `confidence_engine.evolve()`, and verified with `tests/test_evidence_funnel.py` wiring canary. Post-fix 35-day replay delivered 15 resolutions (4 SUPPORTED, 11 CONTRADICTED), moving 15 lineages off prior 0.50. |
| **SD-008** | **DP Lifecycle Predictive Underperformance & Calibration Bound** | Across three DP arms (Fix A, Fix B, combined), S1/S3 Brier regret remained ~0.06 vs FlatBayesian ~0.0005-0.018, unmoved by the wiring fixes; recall gains came with precision collapse (S1 precision 1.00->0.33). Provisional structural interpretation: the lifecycle trades predictive calibration for auditability; pending clean confirmation (C6 COMMIT 2). | Benchmark Gate A & Gate E4. Prevents claims of predictive superiority over baseline learners. | `OPEN (Diagnostic Reading Registered)`. Governance note: Pending clean confirmation test under `gate_e4_v2.yaml`. |

## Detailed Scientific Debt Records

### SD-008: DP Lifecycle Predictive Underperformance & Calibration Bound

* **Status**: `OPEN (Diagnostic Reading Registered)`
* **Statement**: "Across three DP arms (Fix A, Fix B, combined), S1/S3 Brier regret remained ~0.06 vs FlatBayesian ~0.0005-0.018, unmoved by the wiring fixes; recall gains came with precision collapse (S1 precision 1.00->0.33). Provisional structural interpretation: the lifecycle trades predictive calibration for auditability; pending clean confirmation (C6 COMMIT 2)."
* **Governance Note**: SD-008 may NOT be cleared by tuning constants against the benchmark scenarios; it is evaluated strictly under the pre-registered `gate_e4_v2.yaml` confirmation test.

## 2. Governance Invariant

No scientific debt entry may be cleared without:
1. An updated matched-state replication run proving the resolution of the debt.
2. An updated entry in the **EkamNet Evidence Ledger** showing progress to a higher Evidence Level ($L+1$).
3. A formal decision entry in the **EkamNet Decision Ledger**.
