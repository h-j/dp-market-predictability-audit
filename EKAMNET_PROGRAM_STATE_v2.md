## 1. Governance Migration & Correction Table
This table outlines the corrections applied to the program state to eliminate claim drift and separate operational implementation from scientific maturity.

| Old State Element | Identified Inconsistency / Claim Drift | Corrective Action in State v2.0 | Scientific Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Milestone Mapping** | Milestone 4 was missing from the state logs. Milestone 8 was placed ahead of Milestone 9 despite requiring it as a block dependency. | Reorganized milestones in `EKAMNET_MILESTONE_MAP.md`. Documented the merge of Milestone 4 into Milestone 3. Postponed Milestone 8 to follow Milestone 9. | Establishes internal consistency and correct capability ordering. |
| **Candidate F (EF-001)** | Historically referred to as "validated novelty routing," implying a performance lift. | Downgraded claim maturity. Licensed only local trajectory shifts at Step 3; explicitly noted that final step (Day 9) converged back to control with exact 0.00 PnL delta. | Prevents strengthening the scientific claim beyond empirical data boundaries. |
| **MLC (EF-004)** | Historically described as a "complete causal learning loop," masking performance degradation. | Reclassified learning loop behavior as a double-edged sword that degrades performance under context-shift (-76.92% selection rate). | Captures context-dependent risks and prevents false-admission optimism. |
| **Decision Logging** | Sibling generation decisions (DEC_003, DEC_005) were modified and overwritten over time. | Transitioned to a dedicated, versioned `EKAMNET_DECISION_LEDGER.md` preserving all status changes (ACTIVE, SUPERSEDED, etc.). | Preserves decision history and research path auditability. |
| **Trade Feedback Loop** | Downstream paper trader sizer/PnL mutated cognition confidence states directly. | Severed trade feedback (Phase 0 remediation). Re-enforced strict observer-only contract in `AGENTS.md` and AST regression tests. | Preserves pure reflective cognition; prediction must remain indirect and non-optimized for. |
| **Confidence Evolution Engine (PROMPT R1)** | Keyword-based confidence updates allowed LLM prose text to influence belief update path. | Replaced `ConfidenceEvolutionEngine` with `ScoredConfidenceEngine` (Beta posterior on predicate validation outcomes). Downgraded prior confidence-evolution scientific results as superseded. | Eliminates text keyword leakage into live confidence path; belief state is now driven purely by resolved predicate validation states, staleness decay, and contradiction counts. |

## 3. Scientific Verification Maturity (Claims Status)

*   **Candidate F Causal Influence (EQ-001 / EF-001)**: `LOCAL_ROUTING_SHIFT_VALIDATED_BUT_LONGITUDINAL_CONVERGENT`. Matches matched treatment runs (L4). Causal trajectory shift is local to Step 3. EVENTUAL CONVERGENCE observed on Day 9 with exactly 0.00 PnL difference. Reconciled as Outcome Category D (Empirical Propagation Failure / NO_CAUSAL_INFLUENCE_DETECTED_IN_BOUNDED_EXPERIMENT).
*   **MLC Pairwise Competition (EF-004)**: `HIGH_SELECTION_RISK_AND_WEAK_SIGNAL_DEFERRAL_DEMONSTRATED`. False winner rate is 46.0% (L3). Safeguard does not reduce false-admissions on primary false-admission metrics, but rejects 13.04% of confounding winners. Deferral rate of weak causal signals is 100% (reducing true causal admission from 7.41% to 0.0%).
*   **MLC Minimal Learning Loop (Milestone 7 / EF-004)**: `CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_LOOP_INTERVENTION_DEMONSTRATED`. Pruning trigger fields improves causal selection by +53.85 percentage points in stable environments, but collapses selection by -76.92 percentage points in context-shift environments (L3 demonstrated). Negative memory trigger overgeneralization is a proven risk.
*   **Two-Stage Proposition Compilation (Phase 1.7 / EF-005)**: `COMPILER_CONVERGENCE_VERIFIED_BUT_OBSERVATIONAL_ONLY`. Eliminates threshold hallucinations and relative reference fumbles (L2/L3). Replay decisions remain unchanged.
*   **Proposition Validation Engine (Milestone 9 / EF-006)**: `VALIDATION_ENGINE_AND_IMMUTABILITY_VERIFIED`. Conceptually and code-verified. Runs deterministically, records observations, and persists immutable validation outcomes. Retrospective validation terminal states verified.
*   **Closed-Loop Belief Update & Stabilization (Milestone 10 / Remediation)**: `VERIFIED & STABILIZED`. Verified confidence evolution, contradiction zone mapping, theory survival tracking, and experience loop attribution without trade-sourced feedback loops. 243/243 total suite tests pass cleanly.

6. Negative results are valid results.
7. Absence of evidence is acceptable.
8. A governing hypothesis may fail.
9. Implementation momentum must not override scientific validity.

*   **Engineering Frontier**: Scaling offline cached replay validation and lineage visualization over multi-symbol market datasets.

---

## 6. Program Risk Register
1.  **`CANONICAL_STATE_DRIFT_RISK`**: The risk that scientific interpretations become stronger in canonical state files than underlying code and execution evidence supports. Mitigated by this governance v2.0 package.
2.  **`EVIDENCE_TO_ARCHITECTURE_INFERENCE_RISK`**: The risk of concluding that one architecture option is correct/superior solely because a different option is shown to be strained, without directly testing the proposed option.
3.  **`EPISTEMIC_RECALL_CYCLE`**: The risk of reviving a previously refuted candidate from dormancy due to truncation of historical validation records. Mitigated by enforcing 100% validation log preservation in dormancy.
4.  **`P1-P6_BOUNDARY_CONTRACTS_BYPASS`**: Milestone 5, 6, and 7 verification completion check gates are bypassed (hardcoded to `PASS`) in the validator script `verify_scientific_closures.py`, rendering the scientific closures unverified in automated checks.
5.  **`UNCONTAINED_FEEDBACK_LOOP_RISK`**: The risk of downstream decision/sizing components mutating cognition confidence states. Mitigated by Phase 0 explicit observer-only contract in `AGENTS.md` and AST regression tests (`tests/test_no_trade_feedback.py`).
6.  **`SILENT_COGNITION_FAILURE_RISK`**: The risk of silent exception suppression corrupting cognition state. Mitigated by Phase 3 exception triage and `_degraded_steps` tracking in `replay_engine.py`.

## 7. Phase 1C Scientific Progress & Experimental Findings

### 7.1 EXP-1C.1 Diagnostic Replay (10-Day Reliance Window)
*   **Status**: COMPLETED (`commit 56dd7dd`)
*   **Execution Integrity**: 0 degraded steps across 10 matched seed runs (Control $C_0$ vs Intervention $I_1$, $k=5$).
*   **Finding**: $D_{\text{epistemic}} = 0.0$. On short single-regime 10-day windows, zero theory falsification events occur naturally.

### 7.2 EXP-1C_60D Multi-Regime Replay (60-Day Reliance Window)
*   **Status**: COMPLETED (`commit e4d25fa`)
*   **Execution Integrity**: 0 degraded steps across 60 steps $\times$ 10 runs (100% operational reliability).
*   **Finding**: $D_{\text{epistemic}} = 0.0$. In un-perturbed market replays, theories remain within valid bounds ($\text{score} \ge 0.5$). `LessonExtractor` requires $\ge 2$ recurring falsification instances to persist a lesson. Without falsifications, no lessons accumulate naturally.

### 7.3 EXP-1C.2 Controlled Epistemic Stress Experiment (60-Day Window)
*   **Status**: COMPLETED (`commit 72f099c`)
*   **Protocol**: [EXP_1C_2_CONTROLLED_EPISTEMIC_STRESS_PROTOCOL.md](file:///Users/hemantj/.gemini/antigravity-ide/brain/877ece6d-f299-4c12-b07c-dfc28f55cd90/EXP_1C_2_CONTROLLED_EPISTEMIC_STRESS_PROTOCOL.md)
*   **Three-Tier Evaluation Results**:
    1.  **Level 1 (Engineering Stability)**: `VERIFIED` (0 degraded steps across all runs).
    2.  **Level 2 (Learning Activation)**: `ACTIVATED` ($Y_{\text{lesson}} = 2.0$ active failure attribution lessons extracted and persisted into `LessonRepository` per run under regime shock mode $S_{\text{shock}}$, and $Y_{\text{lesson}} = 1.0$ under pre-warmed seeding mode $S_{\text{seed}}$).
    3.  **Level 3 (Causal Cognitive Adaptation)**: `INVARIANT` ($D_{\text{epistemic}} = 0.0$).
*   **Scientific Forensic Discovery**: `NoveltyDetectionGate` evaluates existing theories as `REINFORCE` or `REVISE` during replay steps, preserving structural theory component stability unless a full `GENERATE` decision is triggered.

---

## 8. Phase 1D Experience → Cognition Causal Bridge Validation

### 8.1 Candidate Alpha Implementation (Lesson-Aware Novelty Gate)
*   **Architecture**: Added `lesson_pressure` (Factor 5) to `NoveltyDetectionGate.compute_novelty_score` and passed active failure lessons into the Micro Reflection Critique prompt.
*   **Protocol**: [PHASE_1D_EPISTEMIC_BRIDGE_ARCHITECTURE_AND_PROTOCOL.md](file:///Users/hemantj/.gemini/antigravity-ide/brain/877ece6d-f299-4c12-b07c-dfc28f55cd90/PHASE_1D_EPISTEMIC_BRIDGE_ARCHITECTURE_AND_PROTOCOL.md)

### 8.2 EXP-1D.1 Scientific Validation Results
*   **Status**: COMPLETED & SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDATED (`commit d9f81a2`)
*   **Matched Seeds**: $k=5$ matched seed pairs ($\{42, 100, 200, 500, 777\}$) over 60 trading days under $S_{\text{shock}}$.
*   **Three-Tier Evaluation Results**:
    1.  **Level 1 (Engineering Stability)**: `VERIFIED` (0 degraded steps across all 60 steps $\times$ 10 runs).
    2.  **Level 2 (Learning Activation)**: `ACTIVATED` ($Y_{\text{lesson}} = 2.0$ lessons extracted and persisted).
    3.  **Level 3 (Causal Cognitive Adaptation)**: **`VALIDATED` ($D_{\text{epistemic}} = 0.4286 > 0.25$ threshold)**.
*   **Causal Mechanism**:
    *   Legacy Gate ($C_0$): Issued **0 GENERATE decisions** post-shock (stuck in `REINFORCE`).
    *   Candidate Alpha Gate ($I_1$): Issued **10 GENERATE decisions** post-shock, forcing full theory generation that actively consumes persisted failure lessons and mutates theory claims.
*   **North Star Verdict**: **VALIDATED** — Stored epistemic experience causally alters future cognitive behavior.

### 8.3 EXP-1D.2 Extended Replication (10 Seeds, 120 Days on Reliance)
*   **Status**: COMPLETED & GRADUATED TO LEVEL 4 REPLICATED EVIDENCE
*   **Scale**: 10 matched seed pairs ($k=10$, 20 full 120-day runs, 2,400 trading steps).
*   **Findings**:
    1.  **Level 1 Stability**: `VERIFIED` (0 degraded steps across 2,400 steps).
    2.  **Level 2 Activation**: $Y_{\text{lesson}} = 4.0$ active failure lessons extracted per run across 4 shock windows ($t \in \{15, 35, 75, 95\}$).
    3.  **Level 3 Adaptation**: **$D_{\text{epistemic}} = 0.4286 > 0.25$** ($C_0$: 0 GENERATE decisions vs $I_1$: 40 GENERATE decisions).

## 9. Phase 2A — Longitudinal Cognition & Trajectory Characterization

### 9.1 EXP-2.1 Longitudinal Experience Curve (360 Days on RELIANCE)
*   **Status**: COMPLETED & SCIENTIFICALLY CHARACTERIZED (`commit 30d5ca8`)
*   **Scale**: 10 full 360-day replays (5 matched seed pairs $k=5$, 3,600 total trading steps) across 12 monthly sampling checkpoints ($T_1 \dots T_{12}$) under 6 bi-monthly regime shocks ($t \in \{30, 90, 150, 210, 270, 330\}$).
*   **Findings**:
    1.  **Level 1 Stability**: `VERIFIED` (0 degraded steps across all 3,600 trading steps).
    2.  **Trajectory Classification**: **`ASYMPTOTE / STABLE EQUILIBRIUM`** ($D_{\text{epistemic}} = 0.4286$).
    3.  **Dynamic Profile**:
        *   **Shock Months (M1, M3, M5, M7, M9, M11):** $\pi_{\text{GENERATE}} = 0.0333$ (forces theory generation consuming active lessons).
        *   **Quiescent Months (M2, M4, M6, M8, M10, M12):** $\pi_{\text{REINFORCE}} = 1.0000$ (reuses failure-resilient theory).
    4.  **Verdict**: Cognition adapts rapidly to regime shocks and stabilizes into a resilient asymptotic equilibrium without over-falsification or epistemic collapse.

### 9.2 EXP-2.2 Adaptation Dynamics & REVISE Corridor Forensics
*   **Status**: COMPLETED & SCIENTIFICALLY CHARACTERIZED (`commit b68f12a`)
*   **Advanced Metric Profile**:
    *   **Text Epistemic Divergence ($D_{\text{epistemic}}$)**: $0.4286$
    *   **Mechanism Component Divergence ($D_{\text{mech}}$)**: $0.4000$
    *   **Theory Information Entropy ($H_{\text{theory}}$)**: $6.8920$ bits (rich vocabulary diversity)
    *   **Lesson Utilization Rate ($U_{\text{lesson}}$)**: $1.00$ under $S_{\text{shock}}$
*   **Dynamical Regime Classification**: **`RESILIENT ATTRACTOR / LIMIT CYCLE`** (true cognitive equilibrium).

### 9.3 Phase 2C Decision Surface Mapping & Cognitive Geometry (EXP-2C.1)
*   **Status**: COMPLETED & SCIENTIFICALLY CHARACTERIZED (`commit 38f9021`)
*   **Scale**: Full 6D continuous parameter grid sweep across 18,480 parameter coordinates ($S_{\text{val}} \times Sim \times F_{\text{ratio}} \times P_{\text{cov}} \times L_{\text{pres}} \times C$).
*   **Decision Surface Partitioning**:
    *   **Without Lessons ($L_{\text{pres}} = 0$)**: $\Omega_{\text{REINFORCE}} = 36.62\%$, $\Omega_{\text{REVISE}} = 59.47\%$, $\Omega_{\text{GENERATE}} = 3.91\%$ ($H_{\text{dec}} = 1.1594$ bits).
    *   **With Lessons ($L_{\text{pres}} = 1$)**: $\Omega_{\text{REINFORCE}} = 0.00\%$, $\Omega_{\text{REVISE}} = \mathbf{49.64\%}$, $\Omega_{\text{GENERATE}} = \mathbf{50.36\%}$ ($H_{\text{dec}} = 1.0000$ bits).
*   **Falsification Verdict**: **FALSIFIED** — The hypothesis that the `REVISE` corridor is "mathematically bypassed" is falsified. When active lessons exist, `REVISE` is not impossible or narrow; it occupies **49.64% of the continuous 6D parameter space volume**.
*   **Dynamical System Classification**: **Piecewise Continuous Threshold-Based Controller with Half-Space Bifurcation**.

## 10. Read-Side Provenance & Counterfactual Ablation Protocol (PROMPTS E0a, E0b, E1)

### 10.1 PROMPT E0a — Read-Side Provenance & Consultation Ledger
* **Status**: COMPLETED & VERIFIED (`commit c893628`)
* **Substrate**: Append-only `ConsultationLedger` (`dp/observability/consultation_ledger.py`) recording all cognitive consultations without wall-clock fields. 100% byte-stability verified across duplicate runs.
* **Analysis Tool**: `dp.observability.influence_trace` computing multi-hop transitive influence taints.

### 10.2 PROMPT E0b — Synthworld Benchmark Port & DPAdapter
* **Status**: COMPLETED & VERIFIED (`commit 3fbc8ea`)
* **Substrate**: Market-free configuration with deterministic `TrivialTheoryGenerator` and `DPAdapter` (`bench/synthworld/dp_adapter.py`) implementing 3-method `Learner` protocol (`observe`, `predict`, `beliefs`).
* **Hypothesis Space Equality**: Verified exact set equality `set(adapter.hypothesis_space) == set(baseline.hypothesis_space)`.
* **Smoke Run Performance**: 200-step S1 run completed with Brier Score **0.0074**, Discovery Rate **1.0** (100%), and 800 `role="gate"` consultation entries recorded.

### 10.3 PROMPT E1_v2 — Counterfactual Ablation Protocol & Precondition Gate Verdict
* **Status**: **`ACTIVE — POSITIVE CONTROL PASSED / MARKET RUN REFUSED`** (`commit eed6e72` / `experiments/run_e1_full_protocol.py`)
* **Positive Control Validation**:
  - `DPAdapter` on scenario S1 promoted `(c1, e1)` belief to established tier ($E[\text{Beta}]=0.9595$, evidence count $13.34 \ge 5$).
  - Ablating `(c1, e1)` produced 17 output divergences out of 50 predictions ($P_{\text{trace}} \cap D_{\text{obs}} = 17$, $D_{\text{obs}} \setminus P_{\text{trace}} = \emptyset$).
  - Positive control **PASSED**: verified influence set is non-empty and 100% predicted.
* **Market Replay Precondition Gate**:
  - 35-day baseline market replay (`run_20260724_120559`) evaluated lineage confidence states.
  - Highest confidence lineage `10:theory:0` reached confidence $0.6667 > 0.65$, but evidence count sat at **1.0 < 5.0**.
  - Market ablation run **`REFUSED / BLOCKED ✗`** per `gate_a.yaml` pre-registered criteria.
* **Reportable Scientific Unit**: The pairing ("Positive control proves instrument detects causal influence; 35-day market run refused due to evidence rate precondition") is the authoritative reportable scientific unit under repo governance (`DEC-012`).

## 11. Synthetic Benchmark Battery & Gate A Evaluation (PROMPT E2)

### 11.1 PROMPT E2 — 20-Seed Synthetic Battery & ECE Calibration (Initial Run)
* **Status**: **`VOID`** (`commit 50a7737` / `bench/run_e2.py`)
* **Governance Correction (PROMPT C1)**: Section 11.1 results declared **`VOID`** (criteria not pre-registered; non-conformant benchmark). Superseded by Section 11.2 (PROMPT C3 / E2_v2).

### 11.2 PROMPT C3 / E2_v2 — 20-Seed Reference Synthetic Battery & Gate A Branch Verdict
* **Status**: **`ACTIVE — GATE A VERDICT: [AMBIGUOUS]`** (`commit dc5502d` / `bench/run_e2_v2.py`)
* **Execution**: 20 seeds (0..19) $\times$ 4 scenarios ($T=3000, 3000, 4000, 4000$) $\times$ 5 learners on verified external reference benchmark (`commit dc5502d`).
* **Key Findings**:
  - **S2 Decoy Resistance (PASS)**: DP/EkamNet = `0.0000` decoy claims vs FlatBayesian = `1.0500` (100% precision vs 65.8%).
  - **S3 Recovery Speed (PASS)**: DP/EkamNet = `292.5 steps` vs FlatBayesian = `1873.8 steps` (unlearning died rules 6.4x faster).
  - **S3 Collateral Degradation (FAIL)**: DP/EkamNet = `0.0093` vs WindowedFrequency = `0.0079`.
  - **S1 Brier Regret (FAIL)**: DP/EkamNet = `0.0679` vs FlatBayesian = `0.0005` (static stream penalty due to promotion thresholding).
  - **Calibration**: DP/EkamNet ECE = `0.1630` across all scenarios $\times$ 20 seeds.
* **Registered Governance Consequence**: Per `gate_a.yaml` `AMBIGUOUS` branch, mixed results require registering an extension (longer horizons or higher seed counts) without modifying frozen parameters ($k_{\text{falsify}}=3.0, \lambda=0.01$, promotion tiers).
### 11.3 Milestone E4 — Design-Change Confirmation Battery & Gate E4_v2 Certified Verdict
* **Status**: **`ACTIVE — CERTIFIED GATE E4_v2 VERDICT: [STRUCTURAL_CALIBRATION_BOUND]`** (PROMPT C6 COMMIT 2 / `DEC-016`)
* **Execution**: Executed 20-seed confirmation battery (4 scenarios $\times$ 20 seeds $\times$ 7 learners) against pre-registered `experiments/preregistration/gate_e4_v2.yaml` (`sha256 ee7973c5b...`). Frozen constants verified at runtime ($k_{\text{falsify}}=3.0, \lambda=0.01$, threshold $=0.50$).
* **Certified Mechanical Findings**:
  - **H1 Fix A Calibration (FAIL)**: DP/EkamNet-E4 S1 Brier regret = `0.0593` (target $\le 0.010$), S3 Brier regret = `0.0578` (target $\le 0.010$).
  - **H2 Fix B Scoped Discovery (FAIL)**: DP/EkamNet-E4 S4 Recall = `1.0000` (target $\ge 0.90$), S4 Precision = `0.5000` (target $\ge 0.90$).
  - **Precision Guard (REGRESSION)**: Fix B recall gains in E4b and E4 arms came with precision collapse on S1 (1.00 -> 0.33) and S3 (1.00 -> 0.33), correctly flagged as `REGRESSION`.
  - **No-Decoy Regression Guard (PASS)**: DP/EkamNet-E4 = **0.00 Decoy Claims** on S2.
  - **Calibration**: Overall ECE = `0.1395` under E4 (vs `0.1630` in E2_v2).
* **Registered Governance Resolution**: Certified verdict is **`STRUCTURAL_CALIBRATION_BOUND`**. SD-008 calibration arm is marked `RESOLVED-STRUCTURAL`: the lifecycle trades predictive calibration for auditability; not tunable without abandoning evidence-gating. Contribution repositions from "better predictor" to "auditable learner for regulated decisions" (P1 counterfactual replay & provenance verification unaffected).
