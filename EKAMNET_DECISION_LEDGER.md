### DEC-014: Registration of Gate E4 Verdict [PARTIAL_FIX_B] from Milestone E4 Battery (PROMPT E4)

* **Date**: 2026-07-24
* **Status**: `ACTIVE`
* **Statement**: `"GATE E4 VERDICT: PARTIAL_FIX_B — Fix B (scope-keyed belief representation (c, e, x)) resolves S4 scoped reasoning (raising recall from 0.00 to 1.00) and S1/S2 discovery recall (raising recall from 0.45 to 1.00) while maintaining 0.00 decoy claims. Fix A (s_hat empirical rule strength) improves ECE (0.1395) but requires prior smoothing for early-stream Brier regret."`
* **Context**: Executed Milestone E4 20-seed synthetic battery (4 scenarios $\times$ 20 seeds $\times$ 7 learners) comparing isolated arms E4a (Fix A only), E4b (Fix B only), and E4 (Combined) on the verified reference benchmark (`commit dc5502d`). Evaluated `gate_e4.yaml` criteria mechanically:
  - **S4 Scoped Discovery Recall (PASS)**: DP/EkamNet-E4 = `1.00` vs E2_v2 = `0.00` (100% recall of context-gated rules).
  - **S1 Discovery Recall (PASS)**: DP/EkamNet-E4 = `1.00` vs E2_v2 = `0.45` (100% recall of true rules).
  - **S2 Decoy Resistance (PASS)**: DP/EkamNet-E4 = `0.00` decoy claims (100% decoy trap resistance).
  - **S1 Brier Regret (PARTIAL)**: DP/EkamNet-E4 = `0.0593` (requires early-stream prior smoothing for s_hat).
* **Decision**: Mechanically evaluate the pre-registered `gate_e4.yaml` three-branch interpretation table:
  - **Branch**: **`PARTIAL_FIX_B`**
  - **Consequence**: Fix B scope keying successfully resolves S4 scoped reasoning and S1/S2 discovery recall. Fix A empirical probability estimation improves ECE to 0.1395 but requires prior smoothing for early-stream convergence.
  - **Action**: Register scope-keyed representation for Phase 2 and register probability estimator prior smoothing experiment.

### DEC-013: Registration of Gate A Branch Verdict [AMBIGUOUS] from 20-Seed Reference Battery (PROMPT C3 / E2_v2)

* **Date**: 2026-07-24
* **Status**: `ACTIVE`
* **Statement**: `"GATE A: AMBIGUOUS — evaluated mechanically against e2_v2_results.md (20 seeds, reference benchmark, commit 7f8ae89). Supersedes the prior GATE A: PASS entry, which referenced the void e2_results.md."`
* **Context**: Executed PROMPT C3 / E2_v2 20-seed synthetic battery (4 scenarios $\times$ 20 seeds $\times$ 5 learners) on the verified external reference benchmark (`commit dc5502d`). Evaluated `gate_a.yaml` criteria mechanically:
  - **S2 Decoy Resistance (PASS)**: DP/EkamNet = `0.0000` decoy claims vs FlatBayesian = `1.0500` (100% precision vs 65.8%).
  - **S3 Recovery Speed (PASS)**: DP/EkamNet = `292.5 steps` vs FlatBayesian = `1873.8 steps` (unlearning died rules 6.4x faster).
  - **S3 Collateral Degradation (FAIL)**: DP/EkamNet = `0.0093` vs WindowedFrequency = `0.0079`.
  - **S1 Brier Regret (FAIL)**: DP/EkamNet = `0.0679` vs FlatBayesian = `0.0005` (static stream penalty due to promotion thresholding).
* **Verbatim Determining Criterion Lines from `gate_a.yaml`**:
```yaml
pass_conditions_simultaneous:
  - "S2 decoy_claims < FlatBayesian AND S2 precision >= FlatBayesian"
  - "S3 recovery_steps < FlatBayesian AND S3 collateral <= WindowedFrequency"
  - "S1 Brier regret <= FlatBayesian"
three_branch_interpretation_table:
  AMBIGUOUS:
    consequence: "Mixed results across scenarios or statistical tie across seed distributions."
    action: "Register extension (more seeds / longer horizons) WITHOUT touching frozen parameters."
```
* **Decision**: Mechanically evaluate the pre-registered `gate_a.yaml` three-branch interpretation table:
  - **Branch**: **`AMBIGUOUS`**
  - **Consequence**: Mixed performance profile across scenarios.
  - **Action**: Register extension (longer horizons or higher seed counts) without modifying frozen parameters ($k_{\text{falsify}}=3.0, \lambda=0.01$, promotion tiers).
* **Consequences**:
  - Registers `GATE A: AMBIGUOUS` as the formal governance state. Supersedes prior `GATE A: PASS` (`DEC-010`).
  - Constants remain frozen. Parameter tuning or prompt tweaking in response to these results is strictly prohibited.

### DEC-012: Counterfactual Ablation Protocol & Precondition Gate Verdict (PROMPT E1_v2)

* **Date**: 2026-07-24
* **Status**: `ACTIVE`
* **Statement**: `"POSITIVE CONTROL: PASS (verified influence non-empty: 17/50 decisions diverged). MARKET RUN: REFUSED (preconditions failed: max evidence count 1.0 < 5.0)."`
* **Context**: Executed PROMPT E1_v2 full protocol:
  1. **Positive Control**: Instrument validation on `DPAdapter` (50 steps S1 benchmark) promoted `c1 -> e1` to established tier ($E[\text{Beta}]=0.9595$, evidence count $13.34 \ge 5$). Ablating `c1 -> e1` produced 17 output divergences out of 50 predictions ($P_{\text{trace}} \cap D_{\text{obs}} = 17$, $D_{\text{obs}} \setminus P_{\text{trace}} = \emptyset$). Positive control **PASSED**.
  2. **Market Replay Precondition Gate**: 35-day baseline market replay (`run_20260724_120559`) evaluated lineage confidence states. Highest confidence lineage `10:theory:0` reached confidence $0.6667 > 0.65$, but evidence count sat at **1.0 < 5.0**.
* **Decision**: Mechanically enforce `gate_a.yaml` preconditions. Refuse market ablation replay on low-evidence lineages. Pair positive-control success with market precondition refusal as the authoritative reportable scientific unit.
* **Consequences**:
  - Validates counterfactual ablation instrument and consultation ledger wiring.
  - Prevents invalid scientific claims from ablating un-established or low-evidence market lineages.

### DEC-011: Reversal of Gate A Branch Outcome (PROMPT C1)

* **Date**: 2026-07-24
* **Status**: `ACTIVE`
* **Statement**: `"GATE A: PASS (DEC-010) REVERTED: criteria were not pre-registered; benchmark non-conformant; result void."`
* **Context**: External verification found that the E2 experiment ran without pre-registered gate criteria (no `gate_a.yaml` existed prior to execution), on a benchmark environment containing non-conformant baseline implementations, with contradictory result sets.
* **Decision**: Revert `DEC-010` in full per append-only ledger governance rules. Declare the un-preregistered `GATE A: PASS` claim void pending registered re-run under pre-registered `experiments/preregistration/gate_a.yaml`.
* **Consequences**:
  - Reverts `DEC-010` status to `VOID / REVERTED`.
  - Mandates complete pre-registration of `experiments/preregistration/gate_a.yaml` before any subsequent benchmark evaluation.

## Decision Record Details

### DEC-010: Gate A Branch Outcome Registration (PROMPT E2)

* **Date**: 2026-07-24
* **Status**: `ACTIVE`
* **Context**: PROMPT E2 executed a 20-seed synthetic battery (4 scenarios $\times$ 20 seeds $\times$ 4 learners) evaluating `DPAdapter` against `TruModalOracle`, `ElatraverianLearner`, and `ContextualBayesianLearner`. Frozen constants ($k_{\text{falsify}}=3.0$, $\lambda=0.01$) were enforced.
* **Decision**: Mechanically evaluate Gate A branch criteria against `bench/results/e2_results.md` metrics:
  - **Criterion 1 (PASS)**: DPAdapter S2 Decoy Sensitivity (`0.9943`) is lower than Elatraverian baseline (`1.0000`).
  - **Criterion 2 (PASS)**: DPAdapter S3 Recovery Steps (`33.8 steps`) is $\le 100$ steps (outperforming Elatraverian's `99.3 steps`).
  - **Criterion 3 (PASS)**: DPAdapter S2 Brier Regret (`0.0046`) is $\le$ Elatraverian (`0.0424`).
  - **Overall Verdict**: **`GATE A: PASS`**.
* **Consequences**:
  - Registers `GATE A: PASS` as the formal governance branch.
  - Characterization and parameter freeze becomes the target for the next research milestone per registered interpretation rules.

## Decision Record Details

### DEC-008: Transition to Structural Identity for Cognitive Objects (PROMPT R2)

* **Date**: 2026-07-23
* **Status**: `ACTIVE`
* **Context**: Scientific Debt SD-001 recorded that prompt-layout modifications (e.g. correcting section headers or whitespace) changed text SHA-256 hashes, rendering pre-registered lineage IDs unreachable and forcing hardcoded hex targets.
* **Decision**: Sever identity of evolving cognitive objects (theories, abstractions, propositions, lineages) from LLM text content hashes. Introduce deterministic **Structural Identity** formatted as `"{day}:{stage}:{family_ordinal}"` (e.g. `"0:theory:0"`). Content hashes are retained on objects as `content_hash` strictly for integrity/deduplication.
* **Lineage Identity Policy**: Founding theory structural ID (`"0:theory:0"`) serves as `lineage_id`; all descendant mutations inherit this founding `lineage_id`.
* **Ablation & Targeting Policy**: All counterfactual and ablation harnesses target lineages via `structural_id` or `lineage_id`. Hardcoded hex hash strings (e.g. `5f33fb88966dd952`, `c9c6c6d7bb71fede`) are retired.
* **Consequences**:
  - Eliminates identity drift caused by prompt layout changes.
  - Clears Scientific Debt SD-001.

### DEC-009: Pre-Registered Verification Gates & Retirement of SD-006 (PROMPT R3)

* **Date**: 2026-07-23
* **Status**: `ACTIVE`
* **Context**: Scientific Debt SD-006 recorded that Milestone 5, 6, and 7 completion gates in `verify_scientific_closures.py` were hardcoded to `PASS` because no Minimum Meaningful Effect (MME) thresholds were pre-registered.
* **Decision**: Eliminate all hardcoded `PASS` literals from `verify_scientific_closures.py`. Define pre-registered MME thresholds in `config/cognition.yaml` (M5 lift >= +0.10, M6 steps <= 20, M7 lift >= +0.10 & degradation >= -0.10). Gates evaluate experiment artifacts dynamically and return `PASS | FAIL | INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE`. Missing artifacts or undersampled runs default to `INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE` (never `PASS`).
* **Consequences**:
  - Reverts unverified milestones (M5, M6 to `INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE`, M7 to `FAILED`) in `EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE_v2.md` until MME thresholds are empirically met.
  - Clears Scientific Debt SD-006.
