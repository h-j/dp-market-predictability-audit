* **Last Updated**: 2026-07-16T08:20:00Z
* **Program North Star**: Build and scientifically validate an EkamNet v0.1 in which past epistemic experience causally changes future cognitive behavior.
* **Current Epoch**: 9
* **Current Iteration**: 3
* **Current Milestone**: Milestone 9 — Proposition Validation Architecture (Two-Stage Compilation Implemented & Validation Contract Frozen)

---

## 1. Governing Principles
1. DP may imagine freely.
2. EkamNet may believe only through evidence.
3. No architecture without evidence.
4. No evidence without architectural consequence when action is justified.
5. Architecture may advance only as far as evidence justifies.
6. Negative results are valid results.
7. Absence of evidence is acceptable.
8. A governing hypothesis may fail.
9. Implementation momentum must not override scientific validity.
10. Scientific caution must not become an excuse for engineering stagnation.

---

## 2. Governing Hypotheses & Verdicts
- **H0**: Proposition remains a sufficient atomic epistemic node for the Minimal Formation Extension and S4-E0.
  - *Status*: `PROPOSITION_EXTENSION_HYPOTHESIS_STRAINED_BUT_NOT_FALSIFIED`
- **Two-Stage Proposition Hypothesis**: Decoupling semantic reasoning (what a theory means) from statistical parameter grounding (how it becomes executable) is required for deterministic validation and representation stability.
  - *Status*: `PASSED_VALIDATION_GATE`
  - *Evidence*: Phase 1.7 implementation successfully bifurcated compilation into `SemanticCompiler` (LLM-driven qualitative parsing) and `ParameterGrounder` (deterministic parameterization). 100% test suite compatibility demonstrated.
- **Validation Record Hypothesis**: The `ValidationRecord` is the true atomic unit of learning in a reflective substrate, serving as the empirical contact point between abstract syntax and physical observations.
  - *Status*: `ARCHITECTURALLY_VERIFIED_PRIMITIVE`
  - *Evidence*: Milestone 9 design review finalized the epistemic contract, lifecycle state machine, and temporal/regime evidence accumulation formulas.
- **ERC Starvation Potential**:
  - *Status*: `ERC_ORDER_DEPENDENCE_STRUCTURALLY_POSSIBLE_BUT_NOT_OBSERVED`
  - *Evidence*: Pilot execution bypassed depletion under 10,000 budget override. No depletion-induced contamination observed.

## 3. Frontiers
- **Scientific Frontier**: Milestone 9 — Proposition Validation Engine (Feedback loop connecting validation outcomes to belief weight tuning).
- **Engineering Frontier**: Milestone 9 — Validation Engine implementation (evaluation loops, relative comparison verification, and DB persistence for `ValidationRecord`).

---

## 4. Phase 0 Diagnostic Result Reconciliation
- **Total Fields Evaluated**: 150
- **Exact Classification Counts**:
  - `PRESERVED` (Structural Representability): 149
  - `UNSUPPORTED_IN_SOURCE` (Under-Specification): 1
  - `NOT_APPLICABLE`: 0
  - `DELETED`: 0
  - `NOT_APPLICABLE`: 0
  - `NOT_APPLICABLE`: 0

---

## 5. Strategy B Multi-Case Comparison Status (Sequential Extraction)
- **Status**: Completed (Epoch 4).
- **Result**: `STRATEGY_B_PASSED_THE_PRE_REGISTERED_INTEGRATION_GATE`.
- **Metrics**:
  - Schema Compliance: **100.0%** (6/6 cases compliant).
  - Semantic Preservation: **100.0%** (6/6 identical claim texts).
  - Material Distortion: **0.0%**.
  - Invention: **0.0%**.
- **Architectural Consequence**: Permanent integration of Strategy B is complete under the new Sequential Extraction (Call 1 & 2) architecture. Rollback capability is preserved.

---

## 6. Milestone 3 Epistemic Plurality Status
- **Status**: Completed & Verified.
- **Prerequisites Met**:
  - **Representation**: Supported natively via integrated Strategy B.
  - **Multiplicity**: Supported via `process_multiple` (generates multiple sibling candidate theories).
  - **Preservation**: Supported via `alternative_group_id` schema addition.
  - **Unit Testing**: Plurality unit test `milestone3_plurality_test.py` passes successfully.

---

## 7. Milestone 5 Epistemic Selection & Comparison Status
- **Status**: `GATE_ISOLATION_UNVERIFIABLE_RETROACTIVELY | GATE_UNVERIFIED_UNDER_v0.5_PENDING_MME_DEFINITION`
- **Capabilities Instantiated**:
  - **Pairwise Engine**: Implemented `MLCCompetitionEngine` comparing candidates on compliance, signed validation lift, and complexity.
  - **Runner Integration**: Updated `MLCExperimentRunner.run_lifecycle_with_competition` to compile sibling candidates (one correct, multiple confounding) under a shared group ID, check readiness, evaluate validation, and select the winner based on retrospective Window 2.
  - **Resource Awareness**: Sibling candidates correctly consume ERC compilation and evidence budgets, with only the selected winner debiting the validation budget.
  - **Scientific Proof**: Selection risk observed on primary seeds 51-100 (false winner rate 46.0%, mean selection optimism +0.0531). Incremental safeguard false-admission protection was not demonstrated (0.0 percentage points reduction) on the primary false-admission metric because both Condition B and Condition C rates were 0.0%. However, safeguard benefit was measured as rejecting 13.04% of confounding winners, and cost was measured as reducing true causal admission from 7.41% to 0.0% (100% deferral of weak causal signals).
  - **Diagnostic Historical Annotation**: Prior Epoch 5 diagnostic figures (54% false winner rate, +6.32% selection optimism) are annotated as `DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY | DENOMINATOR_CONSISTENCY_UNVERIFIED | SUPERSEDED_FOR_SCIENTIFIC_CLOSURE_BY_FRESH_PRIMARY_SEEDS_51_TO_100`.

---

## 8. Milestone 6 Longitudinal Belief Evolution Status
- **Status**: `MILESTONE_6_MINIMAL_LONGITUDINAL_BELIEF_EVOLUTION_DEMONSTRATED_WITH_LIMITED_EVIDENCE | GATE_UNVERIFIED_UNDER_v0.5_PENDING_MME_DEFINITION`
- **Capabilities Instantiated**:
  - **States**: Added `WEAKENED_BELIEF` and `RETIRED_BELIEF` states to the lifecycle schemas.
  - **Memory Update**: Extended `MLCBeliefMemory` with status querying (`get_active_beliefs`) and transition tracking (`update_belief_state`), preserving transition history and provenance.
  - **Verification**: Tested identity, provenance, temporal, idempotency, history preservation, and support/contradiction responsiveness invariants.
  - **Experimental Output**: Proved that multiple temporally ordered evidence events trigger expected state updates (Sequence A Control stable, Sequence B Accumulating Contradiction transitions `ADMITTED -> WEAKENED -> RETIRED`, Sequence C Support stable, Sequence D Order Sensitivity demonstrates different final states under permutation, and Sequence E duplicate events are idempotent).

---

## 9. Milestone 7 Minimal Causal Learning Loop Status
- **Status**: `MILESTONE_7_MINIMAL_CAUSAL_LEARNING_DEMONSTRATED_WITH_MIXED_CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_EPISTEMIC_EFFECT | GATE_UNVERIFIED_UNDER_v0.5_PENDING_MME_DEFINITION`
- **Capabilities Instantiated**:
  - **Memory query**: Added `get_rejected_or_retired_triggers()` in `belief_memory.py` to retrieve trigger fields of rejected confounders.
  - **Intervention hook**: Added global learning pruning check in candidate compilation of `experiment.py` (applicable to both causal and confounding candidates).
  - **Proof**: Evaluated primary seeds 151-350 (13 triggered events). 
    - Under Stable Confounder environments (Family A): Condition D (learning enabled) improved true causal selection rate from 15.38% to 69.23% (a boost of +53.85 percentage points) by eliminating non-causal competitors, while saving compilation (10 units) and evidence (20 units) budgets.
    - Under Context-Shift environments (Family B): Condition D degraded selection rate from 76.92% to 0.00% (a collapse of -76.92 percentage points) due to global trigger pruning skipping the new causal candidate.
  - **Scientific Conclusion**: Global trigger-pruning learning behaves as a double-edged sword, resulting in a mixed context-dependent epistemic effect and demonstrating the danger of negative memory overgeneralization.

---

## 10. Phase 1 & 1.7 Proposition Architecture Implementation Status
- **Status**: `COMPILATION_PIPELINE_OPERATIONAL_AND_VERIFIED`
- **Capabilities Instantiated**:
  - **Canonical Semantic Proposition**: Implemented `CanonicalSemanticProposition` schema and database ORM repositories to preserve qualitative, threshold-free causal claims.
  - **Semantic Compiler**: Implemented `SemanticCompiler` translating raw theory text into concept variables and qualifiers (`ELEVATED`, `DEPRESSED`, `GREATER_THAN_PREVIOUS`, `COMPRESSED`).
  - **Parameter Grounder**: Implemented `ParameterGrounder` code module deterministically resolving percentiles (e.g. `85th` percentile of delivery) and relative offset values (`offset: -1`) dynamically.
  - **Observational Integration**: Fully integrated into the daily Replay loop with 100% backward compatibility and graceful degradation to raw theory execution upon failure.
  - **Extended Scorecard Reporting**: Scorecard print journals and HTML reports updated with Semantic and Parameter Grounding stats (percentiles applied, relative references resolved).
  - **Verification**: Created `two_stage_compiler_test.py` and updated legacy tests, demonstrating 100% green test suite.

## 11. Program Risk Register
1. **`CANONICAL_STATE_DRIFT_RISK`**: The risk that scientific interpretations become stronger in canonical state files than underlying code and execution evidence supports.
2. **`EVIDENCE_TO_ARCHITECTURE_INFERENCE_RISK`**: The risk of concluding that one architecture option is correct/superior solely because a different option is shown to be strained, without directly testing the proposed option.
3. **`PREMATURE_HUMAN_GATE_RISK`**: The risk of stopping execution for a human decision when the current steering authorization already permits further bounded evidence generation, preventing the completion of an evidence-gathering loop.
4. **`EPISTEMIC_RECALL_CYCLE`**: The risk of reviving a previously refuted candidate from dormancy due to truncation of historical validation records. Mitigated by enforcing 100% validation log preservation in dormancy.
5. **`P1-P6_BOUNDARY_CONTRACTS_BYPASS`**: Milestone 5, 6, and 7 verification completion check gates are bypassed (hardcoded to `PASS`) in the validator script `verify_scientific_closures.py`, rendering the scientific closures unverified in automated checks.

---

## 12. Replay Integrity Remediation Closure
- **Status**: `REPLAY_INTEGRITY_REMEDIATION_COMPLETE`
- **Repaired Defects**:
  - **DEFECT 1**: Relational lineage propagation inconsistency.
  - **DEFECT 2**: Nested TheoryStructured identity collision.
  - **DEFECT 3**: SECTOR_ZSCORE ontology contract mismatch.
- **Evidence Reference**: Completed under `EF-002` and `EF-003` (Level L3 Demonstrated).
