# EKAMNET RESEARCH GOVERNANCE v1.0 FINAL REVIEW
## DP / EKAMNET RESEARCH PROGRAM

---

### 1. Executive Summary

This document performs the final canonicalization review of the EkamNet Research Governance v1.0 suite. This review audits evidence levels and claim strengths, simplifies the program state ledger, registers evidence debt, and evaluates the scientific roadmap. 

Following this review, we recommend reclassifying the Candidate F findings (`EF-001`) from Level L4 to Level L3, as robustness and generalization remain unresolved. The overall verdict is:

**READY_FOR_CANONICAL_FREEZE_AFTER_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES**

---

### 2. Evidence Level Audit

We audited the evidence classification of `EF-001` (Candidate F) against the definitions in the newly established Evidence Ladder:
* **Current Classification**: `L4 (Validated)`
* **Audit Finding**: Under the program's strict taxonomy, Level L4 requires generalization across regimes or assets. Because `EF-001` was evaluated on a single asset (Reliance) and a single 10-day backtest period, its generalization bounds are unresolved.
* **Correction**: Reclassify `EF-001` to **L3 (Reproduced under bounded conditions with independent occurrences)**. This is internally consistent with `ROBUSTNESS_THRESHOLD_UNRESOLVED`.

### 3. Claim Strength Audit

We audited all v1.0 governance documents for over-claiming terminology. The following corrections are canonically established:

| Document | Original Phrasing | Corrected Phrasing | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md` | "Mixed Context-Dependent Epistemic Effect Verified" | "Mixed Context-Dependent Epistemic Effect Observed" | Avoids claiming absolute system validation from a single seed subset. |
| `EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md` | "Selection risk verified on seeds 51-100" | "Selection risk observed on seeds 51-100" | More precise description of backtest observations. |
| `EKAMNET_CAPABILITY_MAP.md` | "Implementation Status: Complete" | "Implementation Status: Implemented (Active)" | "Complete" implies zero remaining validation debt, which is incorrect. |
| `EKAMNET_EXPERIMENTAL_FINDINGS.md`| "Validated target suppression..." | "Observed target suppression..." | Aligns with reclassification to Level L3. |

---

### 4. Program State Simplification

To prevent duplication and maintain the role of `EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md` as a high-level program summary:
* The detailed cognitive delta descriptions of `EF-001`, `EF-002`, and `EF-003` are removed from the Program State file.
* They are replaced by concise 1-sentence summaries pointing to [EKAMNET_EXPERIMENTAL_FINDINGS.md](EKAMNET_EXPERIMENTAL_FINDINGS.md) as the single source of truth.

---

### 5. Evidence Debt Register

We establish the "Evidence Debt" ledger to track the remaining empirical validation required before capabilities can be promoted:

#### EF-001 (Provenance-Driven Novelty Routing)
* **Current Evidence**: Suppression of target retirement successfully executed in 3 matched runs, shifting Step 3 novelty routing targets, followed by Day 9 cognitive and financial convergence.
* **Evidence Debt**:
  1. *Cross-regime replication*: Testing under strongly trending vs range-bound regimes.
  2. *Cross-asset replication*: Testing on Nifty index or other sector assets.
  3. *Longer replay horizons*: Extending backtest from 10 days to 30 or 100 days.
  4. *Robustness characterization*: Temperature and prompt variation sensitivity analysis.

#### EF-002 (Lineage and Nested Identity Remediation)
* **Current Evidence**: Tested invariants on isolated mock inputs.
* **Evidence Debt**: Longitudinal verification under full multi-agent replay runs.

#### EF-003 (Ontology Registry Remediation)
* **Current Evidence**: Verified on a single Reliance 10-day backtest.
* **Evidence Debt**: Verification across all standard benchmark sets to confirm zero regression.

---

### 6. Roadmap Reassessment

We evaluated the program's next steps:
* **Option A**: Research Governance Freeze $\rightarrow$ Candidate F robustness $\rightarrow$ S4-E0
* **Option B**: Research Governance Freeze $\rightarrow$ Candidate F Freeze $\rightarrow$ Milestone 8 $\rightarrow$ Candidate F robustness $\rightarrow$ S4-E0

#### Scientific Recommendation: **Option A**
* *Reasoning*: The Candidate F experiment demonstrated that cognitive trajectory divergence converged under the Step 4 regime transition. This suggests that history-dependent cognitive effects may be highly transient.
* Establishing the robustness bounds of this transient effect (Option A) is a critical scientific dependency. If we proceed to Milestone 8 first (Option B), we risk designing complex co-evolutionary structures on top of a cognitive loop that exhibits complete long-term neutrality. Option A ensures that architectural complexity advances only as far as empirical validity justifies.

### 7. Cross-Document Consistency Audit

We verified the consistency of the four primary governance documents:

| Document | Terminology | Evidence Level | Claim Strength | Roadmap Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md` | Consistent | L3 (EF-001) | Corrected (Observed) | Option A |
| `EKAMNET_CAPABILITY_MAP.md` | Consistent | L3 (EF-001) | Corrected (Observed) | Option A |
| `EKAMNET_EXPERIMENTAL_FINDINGS.md`| Consistent | L3 (EF-001) | Corrected (Observed) | Option A |
| `EKAMNET_EVIDENCE_LADDER.md` | Consistent | L3 (EX-001) | Corrected (Observed) | Option A |

---

### 8. Required Documentation Changes

Before freezing the v1.0 governance suite, the following files must be updated to align with the audit findings:
1. Update `EKAMNET_CAPABILITY_MAP.md` to shift EF-001 capabilities from L4 to L3.
2. Update `EKAMNET_EXPERIMENTAL_FINDINGS.md` to reclassify EF-001 to Level L3, apply audited claim terminology, and append the Evidence Debt section.
3. Update `EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md` to simplify findings descriptions, apply audited terminology, and map Option A as the next action.

### 9. Final Recommendation
