# EKAMNET PROGRAM STATE v1.0 FINAL UPDATE
## DP / EKAMNET RESEARCH PROGRAM

---

### 1. Added Program Evidence Debt Section

We added the top-level section `## Program Evidence Debt` to [EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md](EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md). 

This section explicitly lists the demonstrated evidence bounds alongside the remaining empirical gaps for the three findings:
* **EF-001 (Candidate F)**: Current L3 evidence (local suppression / routing shift under bounded conditions) is contrasted with the debt (cross-regime, cross-asset, longer replay, and temperature characterization). Priority: HIGH. Status: OPEN.
* **EF-002 (Lineage/Nested IDs)**: Current L3 evidence (SQL ↔ JSON propagation and REVISE regeneration verified) is contrasted with the debt (multi-agent orchestration). Priority: MEDIUM. Status: OPEN.
* **EF-003 (Ontology registry)**: Current L3 evidence (SECTOR_ZSCORE repaired and local ID shifts observed) is contrasted with the debt (general regression testing). Priority: MEDIUM. Status: OPEN.

### 2. Wording Refinement

We adopted the refined Milestone 7 descriptor:
* *Original*: `"Replication Completed, Convergence Neutrality Characterized"`
* *Audited / Corrected*: `"Bounded Convergence Behavior Characterized"`
* *Rationale*: This phrasing is scientifically more precise, accurately representing that Control and Treatment converged on Day 9 due to step-counter limits and regime transitions without over-stating a general system-wide "neutrality".

### 3. Consistency Verification

We verified that the newly added Program Evidence Debt section matches the details, terminology, and Evidence Levels within:
* [EKAMNET_EXPERIMENTAL_FINDINGS.md](EKAMNET_EXPERIMENTAL_FINDINGS.md) (both documents align on `EF-001` at Level `L3`).
* [EKAMNET_EVIDENCE_LADDER.md](EKAMNET_EVIDENCE_LADDER.md) (L3 matches the "reproduced under bounded replay conditions" definition).
* [EKAMNET_CAPABILITY_MAP.md](EKAMNET_CAPABILITY_MAP.md) (evidence levels match L3).

### 4. Modification Boundaries Confirmation

We explicitly confirm:
* No code files or database mechanisms were modified.
* No Replay runs were executed.
* Roadmap ordering has not changed (retains the Option B sequence: Governance Freeze $\rightarrow$ Candidate F Freeze $\rightarrow$ Milestone 8 $\rightarrow$ Candidate F Robustness $\rightarrow$ S4-E0).
* No other governance elements or file configurations were modified.

### 5. Final Verdict

**READY_FOR_CANONICAL_FREEZE**
