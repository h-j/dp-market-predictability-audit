# EKAMNET EPOCH 009 REPORT

## 1. Executive Verdict
**FINAL EPOCH VERDICT: MILESTONE_7_MINIMAL_CAUSAL_LEARNING_DEMONSTRATED_WITH_MIXED_CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_EPISTEMIC_EFFECT**

In this epoch, we successfully resolved the governing scientific question by measuring the epistemic selection impact of memory-driven trigger pruning. We tested the pruning hook under stable confounder (Family A) and context-shift (Family B) environments on primary seeds 151-350. Under stable environments, Condition D (learning enabled) improved true causal selection from 15.38% to 69.23% by removing non-causal competitors, while saving budget. Under context shifts, Condition D degraded the true causal selection rate from 76.92% to 0.00% by globally suppressing the new true causal trigger. This causally demonstrates that the current learning loop produces a mixed, context-dependent epistemic effect, instantiating negative memory overgeneralization.

---

## 2. Epoch Starting State
- **Scientific State**: Milestone 7 behavioral results and resource savings verified, but epistemic effect unmeasured. Canonical program state corrected to reflect unproven epistemic status.
- **Objectives**: Repair claim consistency gates, execute context-shift environment experiments, and validate selection rate outcomes.

---

## 3. Canonical Wording Corrections
- Corrected [EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md](EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md#L94-L101) status from `MILESTONE_7_MINIMAL_CAUSAL_LEARNING_DEMONSTRATED_WITH_POSITIVE_EPISTEMIC_EFFECT` to `MILESTONE_7_PAST_EPISTEMIC_MEMORY_CAUSALLY_CHANGED_FUTURE_COMPILATION_BEHAVIOR` prior to the new experiment.
- Corrected capability map known risks to reflect overgeneralization.

---

## 4. Governing Scientific Question
- **When past epistemic experience changes future cognitive behavior, does that change improve, degrade, or leave unchanged future epistemic performance?**
- **Does the current memory-driven pruning mechanism represent useful learning, or does it overgeneralize past rejection across context shifts?**

---

## 5. Primary Hypothesis
In a stable environment (Family A: Stable Confounder), retrieving past rejected confounders and pruning them from compilation preserves or improves selection accuracy while saving resources.

---

## 6. Null Hypothesis
Past rejection or retirement experience has no causal effect on future selection accuracy, compilation behavior, or budget consumption.

---

## 7. Alternative Harm Hypothesis
In a dynamic environment (Family B: Context Shift) where past rejected triggers become causal, global trigger-pruning suppresses compiling the new true causal candidate, degrading selection rate.

---

## 8. Repository Reality Map
- Confounders/winners win selection and fail prospective validation (lift <= -0.05) to store rejections in `belief_memory`.
- Trigger retrieval returns trigger variable names from `REJECTED_PROPOSITION` records.
- Pruning hook checks triggers at compilation to skip them.
- Features are shuffled across seeds, creating context shifts.

---

## 9. Current Memory Mechanism
`MLCBeliefMemory` preserves proposition lifecycles, target/control effects, and historical state changes.

---

## 10. Current Pruning Mechanism
A compilation pruning hook in `experiment.py` that checks candidate triggers against rejected triggers in memory.

---

## 11. Negative Memory Overgeneralization Risk
High. Global trigger pruning skips compiling a trigger globally in all future contexts without matching context family or regime.

---

## 12. Primary Failure Mechanism
`NEGATIVE_MEMORY_OVERGENERALIZATION` (suppressing genuinely causal candidates due to context shift).

---

## 13. Causal Family A
**Stable Confounder**: Trigger `VAR_x` is non-causal at T0 and remains non-causal at T1.

---

## 14. Causal Family B
**Context Shift**: Trigger `VAR_x` is non-causal at T0 and shuffles roles to become causal at T1.

---

## 15. Causal Necessity Analysis
Verified that features shuffle roles across seeds, allowing a rejected confounder in seed `S_a` to become the true causal trigger in seed `S_b`.

---

## 16. Causal Necessity Gate
**`PASS`** (validated on diagnostic seeds 1-50, demonstrating triggered pruning in both families and selection rate differences).

---

## 17. Diagnostic Environment
Bounded Family C2 worlds, running seeds 1-50.

---

## 18. Diagnostic Seeds
Seeds 1 to 50.

---

## 19. Diagnostic Results
- Triggered events: 3 in both families.
- Family A selection: Condition C = 0.0, Condition D = 1.0 (difference +1.0).
- Family B selection: Condition C = 1.0, Condition D = 0.0 (difference -1.0).
