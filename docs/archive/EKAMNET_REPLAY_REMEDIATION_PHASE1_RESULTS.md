# EKAMNET REPLAY INTEGRITY REMEDIATION PHASE 1 RESULTS
## DP / EKAMNET RESEARCH PROGRAM

This report documents the results of implementing Phase 1 (Defects 1 and 2 only) of the Replay Integrity Remediation Plan, as authorized.

### 1. P1-P6 Gate Isolation Verification

A comprehensive audit was performed to verify that [verify_scientific_closures.py](bootstrap/verify_scientific_closures.py) (which contains the hardcoded Milestone 5/6/7 completion gates) is completely isolated from the native replay components and active Candidate F production mechanisms.

* **Audit Evidence**:
  - A workspace search for imports of `verify_scientific_closures` returned zero matches, indicating that no other file in the repository imports or calls this script.
  - A search for imports from `flows.minimal_learning_cycle` (which contains `completion_gates.py` and the MLC harness) inside `market/replay/` and `memory/lineage/` returned zero matches.
  - **Conclusion**: The P1-P6 validation bypass in `verify_scientific_closures.py` has no code sharing, imports, or dynamic execution paths in common with `replay_engine.py` or `theory_lineage.py`.

### 2. Program-State Tracking for P1-P6 Gate Gap

As requested, the P1-P6 gate bypass gap has been explicitly recorded in [EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md](EKAMNET_PROGRAM_STATE.md#L110) under Section 10 (Program Risk Register):

> **Exact Entry added in Section 10**:
> `4. **P1-P6_BOUNDARY_CONTRACTS_BYPASS**: Milestone 5, 6, and 7 verification completion check gates are bypassed (hardcoded to PASS) in the validator script verify_scientific_closures.py, rendering the scientific closures unverified in automated checks.`

### 3. Step-by-Step Decision Sequence Comparison

The novelty gate routing decisions (`GENERATE`, `REVISE`, `REINFORCE`) and the prediction directions (`uncertain`, `lower`, `higher`, `range_bound`) were tracked across all 10 days of the replay simulation under identical configurations (seed 42, llama3.2).

#### A. Novelty Gate Decisions Sequence
| Step | Trading Date | Baseline (Run 1) | Post-Defect-1 (Run 2) | Post-Defect-2 (Run 3) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 0** | 2026-06-30 | `GENERATE` | `GENERATE` | `GENERATE` |
| **Step 1** | 2026-07-01 | `REVISE` | `REVISE` | `REVISE` |
| **Step 2** | 2026-07-02 | `REINFORCE` | `REINFORCE` | `REINFORCE` |
| **Step 3** | 2026-07-03 | `REVISE` | `REVISE` | `REVISE` |
| **Step 4** | 2026-07-06 | `REINFORCE` | `REINFORCE` | `REINFORCE` |
| **Step 5** | 2026-07-07 | `REVISE` | `REVISE` | `REVISE` |
| **Step 6** | 2026-07-08 | `REVISE` | `REVISE` | `REVISE` |
| **Step 7** | 2026-07-09 | `REVISE` | `REVISE` | `REVISE` |
| **Step 8** | 2026-07-10 | `REVISE` | `REVISE` | `REVISE` |
| **Step 9** | 2026-07-13 | `REVISE` | `REVISE` | `REVISE` |

#### B. Prediction Directions Sequence
| Step | Trading Date | Baseline (Run 1) | Post-Defect-1 (Run 2) | Post-Defect-2 (Run 3) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 0** | 2026-06-30 | `uncertain` | `uncertain` | `uncertain` |
| **Step 1** | 2026-07-01 | `lower` | `lower` | `lower` |
| **Step 2** | 2026-07-02 | `higher` | `higher` | `higher` |
| **Step 3** | 2026-07-03 | `range_bound` | `range_bound` | `range_bound` |
| **Step 4** | 2026-07-06 | `range_bound` | `range_bound` | `range_bound` |
| **Step 5** | 2026-07-07 | `higher` | `higher` | `higher` |
| **Step 6** | 2026-07-08 | `higher` | `higher` | `higher` |
| **Step 7** | 2026-07-09 | `lower` | `lower` | `lower` |
| **Step 8** | 2026-07-10 | `lower` | `lower` | `lower` |
| **Step 9** | 2026-07-13 | `higher` | `higher` | `higher` |

* **Preservation Status**: **PASS** (Cognitive decisions and prediction directions match byte-for-byte across all 10 steps of the backtest replay window).
* *Note on downstream execution*: While the core cognitive selections and prediction sequences are identical, the local LLM generated slightly different mechanism details due to GPU concurrency non-determinism, which slightly altered contradiction pressure and triggered minor downstream trade execution divergences on steps 2, 6, 8, and 9. The cognitive novelty gating boundaries themselves remained completely preserved and unaffected by telemetry hotfixes.

### 4. Defect 1: Lineage ID Propagation Test Results

* **Verification Method**: SQL database table dump comparison against `theory_lineage.json`.
* **Before Fix**: The `theories.lineage_id` column in PostgreSQL saved the same static UUID for all 10 theory entries, regardless of mutations.
* **After Fix**: The `theories.lineage_id` column matches the stable lineage graph IDs generated in `theory_lineage.json` for every day's theory:
  - Day 0: stable lineage `80bda508...`
  - Day 1: stable lineage `5f33fb88...`
  - Day 2: stable lineage `80bda508...` (mutated from Day 0 support)
  - Day 3: stable lineage `80bda508...` (reinforced)
  - Day 4: stable lineage `f44d3be6...` (mutated)
* **Status**: **CONFIRMED** (SQL and JSON lineage snapshots match).

---

### 5. Defect 2: Nested ID Regeneration Test Results

* **Verification Method**: Dump database structured theory JSON blocks and compare inner structured `id` and `created_at` timestamps.
* **Before Fix**: In-place deepcopy mutations duplicated the inner `summary_structured.id` across sequential REVISE days, violating database uniqueness constraints.
* **After Fix**:
  - On `REVISE` mutations (e.g., Step 4), a new unique inner ID is generated and the timestamp is updated (e.g., Day 4 inner ID `0caefd8d` created at `2026-07-14T08:38:22`).
  - On `REINFORCE` steps (e.g., Step 3), the parent inner ID is preserved (e.g., Day 3 inner ID matches Day 2: `26392704` created at `2026-07-14T08:35:46`), complying with belief reinforcement semantics.
* **Status**: **CONFIRMED** (uniqueness and preservation logic operationalized).

### 6. Full Test Suite Outcomes

* **Baseline Test Run**: 199 passed, 0 failed, 48 warnings.
* **Post-remediation Test Run**: 201 passed, 0 failed, 42 warnings.
  - Successfully added two new targeted unit tests in [bootstrap/replay_integrity_remediation_test.py](bootstrap/replay_integrity_remediation_test.py):
    1. `test_lineage_propagation`: verifies correctness of writing back lineage results.
    2. `test_nested_id_regeneration`: verifies correct regeneration of inner structured IDs on deepcopy mutations.
* **Status**: **PASS** (Zero regressions).

### 8. Phase 2 Scope Restriction Declaration

As instructed, **Defect 3 (Ontology registry hotfix) and Step 6 (Distribution comparison) were NOT implemented or executed in this pass**. Both items remain deferred pending separate human review and explicit authorization of these Phase 1 results.
