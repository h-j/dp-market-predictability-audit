# Phase 2 — Iteration 2: Adaptive Reflective Cognition
## Implementation Verification Report

**Date**: May 16, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE AND VALIDATED

---

## Implementation Summary

Upgraded the substrate from environmentally grounded reflective cognition to **reality-constrained adaptive reflective cognition**. The system now validates theories against actual market outcomes, evolves confidence using environmental feedback, tracks theory survival/failure, maps recurring contradiction zones, and adapts reflective memory under changing market regimes.

---

## Core Components Implemented

### 1. **Market Outcome Schema** ✅
**Location**: `market/schemas/market_outcome.py`

- Captures realized market behavior after observations/theories
- Fields: realized_trend, volatility, breadth, liquidity, contradictions, confidence
- Enables comparison of predictions vs reality

**Example**:
```
"NIFTY continued higher despite weak breadth, creating divergence."
realized_trend: "up with continuation"
realized_breadth: "weak with divergence"
outcome_contradictions: ["price strength vs weak breadth"]
```

### 2. **Market Outcome Persistence** ✅
**Files**:
- `memory/relational/models/market_outcome_model.py`
- `memory/relational/repositories/market_outcome_repository.py`

- PostgreSQL persistence for outcomes
- Methods: `save()`, `list_recent(limit=20)`
- Enables historical outcome tracking

### 3. **Outcome Validation Engine** ✅
**Location**: `market/validation/outcome_validation_engine.py`

Validates theories against realized outcomes:
- **Trend Alignment**: Checks if outcome trend matches theory expectations
- **Breadth Alignment**: Compares theory breadth assumptions with outcome
- **Liquidity Alignment**: Validates liquidity-based theories
- **Volatility Alignment**: Tests volatility expectations
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies mismatches between assumptions and reality
- **Regime Mismatch**: Detects when market regime shifts from theory predictions

**Output**:
```python
{
    "validation_score": 0.19,  # 0.0-1.0 alignment
    "contradiction_score": 0.70,
    "contradictions_detected": ["price strength vs weak breadth"],
    "validation_summary": "Theory partially supported by market outcome...",
    "adaptation_recommendations": [
        "Consider revising assumptions; reality diverged significantly"
    ]
}
```

### 4. **Theory Survival Tracker** ✅
**Location**: `market/evolution/theory_survival_tracker.py`

Tracks recurring theories and identifies patterns:
- **Strengthening Theories**: Theories improving in validation scores
- **Weakening Theories**: Theories deteriorating over time
- **Unstable Theories**: Recurring hypotheses with poor performance
- **Recurring Failures**: Patterns of failed assumptions

**Sample Output**:
```
"Liquidity-led momentum continuation is weakening under volatile regimes.
Breadth divergence repeatedly reduced coherence."
```

### 5. **Adaptive Confidence Evolution** ✅
**Updated**: `cognition/confidence/confidence_evolution_engine.py`

**Key Enhancement**: Reality-based outcome validation now weighs MORE heavily than linguistic validation

**New Logic**:
- Strong outcome alignment (>0.7): +0.10 empirical delta (vs +0.05)
- Weak outcome alignment (<0.4): -0.12 empirical delta (vs -0.06)
- Outcome contradictions reduce coherence directly
- Regime mismatches lower regime confidence
- Contradiction pressure increases with outcome divergence

**Example Impact**:
```
Before: Empirical Confidence 0.50 → After Strong Outcome: 0.65 (+0.15)
Before: Empirical Confidence 0.50 → After Weak Outcome: 0.43 (-0.07)
```

### 6. **Contradiction Mapper** ✅
**Location**: `market/contradiction/market_contradiction_mapper.py`

Maps recurring contradiction zones:
- **Price vs Breadth**: Price strength despite weak breadth
- **Momentum vs Volatility**: Momentum persistence vs volatility expansion
- **Liquidity vs Participation**: Liquidity concentration vs broad weakness
- **Trend Reversals**: Failed trend assumptions

**Recurring Zone Detection**:
```
Momentum Volatility Mismatch (3 occurrences, severity 0.50)
Liquidity Participation Gap (2 occurrences, severity 0.65)
Trend Reversal Zone (2 occurrences, severity 0.70)
```

### 7. **Reflective Memory Expansion** ✅
**Updated**: `memory/reflection/reflective_memory_synthesizer.py`

Reflective memory now includes:
- **Theory Survival Patterns**: Which theories strengthen/weaken
- **Persistent Market Failures**: Recurring contradiction zones
- **Regime-Sensitive Confidence Shifts**: How confidence adapts to regime changes
- **Weakening Assumptions**: Assumptions visible in failing theories
- **Adaptive Trajectories**: Evolution narrative incorporating reality feedback

**Sample Integration**:
```
"Recent market outcomes validate emerging theoretical patterns.
Market outcomes reveal deteriorating theoretical assumptions.
Pressure: 0.35, Coherence: 0.72."
```

### 8. **Seeded Validation Dataset** ✅
**Location**: `market/examples/sample_nifty_outcomes.py`

15 realistic NIFTY market outcomes:
- Trend continuation with divergence
- Failed momentum under volatility
- Liquidity concentration with weak breadth
- Trend reversals
- Strong liquidity-led continuation
- Breadth-supported moves
- Regime shifts
- Macro sentiment failures

**Enables**:
- Repeatable grounding experiments
- Consistent adaptive cognition testing
- Theory performance tracking

### 9. **Bootstrap Integration** ✅
**Updated**: `bootstrap/run_cognition_loop.py`

**New Cognition Loop Flow**:
