## 3. Priority Check A: MLC v0.1 Gate 1 (Temporal Isolation) Currency

* **Result**: **Bypassed / Inactive**.
* **Analysis**: `MLCValidityGates.run_gates()` and its corresponding `GATE_1` logic are **not** invoked by any active runner for Milestones 5, 6, or 7 (including `milestone7_learning_experiment.py` and `milestone7_epistemic_validation.py`). Although `MLCExperimentRunner` still executes the runtime `check_and_deduct("VALIDATION", ...)` budget checks, the holistic temporal isolation check defined in Gate 1 is never run on the outcomes of active milestones.

---

## 4. Priority Check B: Milestone 5 Isolation Gate Re-verification

* **Result**: **Never Evaluated by Code**.
* **Analysis**: The Milestone 5 Isolation Gate status (`PASS`) reported in `EKAMNET_EPOCH_007_REPORT.md` (and subsequent files) was **never** re-evaluated by any automated Python validation code for the fresh primary run (seeds 51-100). 
  * The status was manually declared as `PASS` and hardcoded inside `verify_scientific_closures.py` when instantiating `MilestoneCompletionGates` for Milestone 5.
  * In the experiment runner itself (`milestone5_experiment_runner.py`), the `"seed_overlap_status": "STRICTLY_SEPARATED"` indicator is hardcoded metadata. No active candidate pool freeze or W3 leakage checks are executed on the data of seeds 51-100.

---

## 5. Priority Check C: Shared vs. Fragmented Gate Architecture

* **Result**: **Severely Fragmented and Post-Hoc**.
* **Analysis**: There is **no common, inline runtime gate-checking path** shared by the active experiment runners:
  * Milestone 5 (`milestone5_experiment_runner.py`), Milestone 6 (`milestone6_evolution_experiment.py`), and Milestone 7 (`milestone7_learning_experiment.py`) all write separate, custom-formatted result files to disk.
  * The gate-checking code path is a separate, post-hoc verification step (`verify_scientific_closures.py`) that reads these files after execution.
  * If a runner is modified or bypassed at runtime, the runner itself will run to completion and write results. The failure is only detected when `verify_scientific_closures.py` is executed post-hoc.

---

## 6. Summary Statistics

* **Total Gates Found**: 10
* **`GATE_LIVE_AND_SOUND`**: 7
* **`GATE_LIVE_BUT_EVALUATION_COMPROMISED`**: 1 (`MilestoneCompletionGates` due to hardcoded input statuses)
* **`GATE_DEFINED_BUT_NOT_INVOKED`**: 2 (`MLCValidityGates`, `MLCPilotValidityGates` relative to active Milestones)
* **`GATE_INVOKED_BUT_OUTPUT_NOT_CONSUMED`**: 0
* **`GATE_STATUS_INDETERMINATE`**: 0

---

## 7. Highest-Risk Finding

* **Finding**: **Milestone 5 Isolation Validation Deficit**.
* **Details**: The Milestone 5 Isolation Gate checks are completely unverified by code on the primary run (seeds 51-100). Because these checks are hardcoded to `PASS` in `verify_scientific_closures.py`, any potential leakage or candidate mutation that occurred during the fresh primary run would go completely undetected by the gate infrastructure.

---

## 8. Recommendations & Canonical State Annotations

1. **Apply Annotations to MLC v0.1**: 
   Since the original MLC v0.1 gates (`MLCValidityGates`) are bypassed by the active milestone runners and have not been validated against the active milestone codebase, the capability map and state files should treat the legacy validation claims with caution. However, because MLC v0.1's smoke and pilot tests successfully ran these gates, the risk is mostly limited to newer milestones claiming validation under the old gates.
2. **Implement Runtime Gates**:
   Ensure that future milestones (e.g. Milestone 8) run the consistency and isolation gates **inline** during experiment execution, causing the runner to immediately fail closed, rather than relying on a separate post-hoc script.
