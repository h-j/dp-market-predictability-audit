# DP/EKAMNET v2.0 COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE REVIEW
**EkamNet Research Program | Final Design Review & Synthesis**  
*Document Status: FINAL DESIGN CONSOLIDATION*  

---

## Executive Summary

This architectural review evaluates the correctness, internal consistency, and scientific roadmapping of the newly consolidated **DP/EkamNet Cognitive Architecture v2.0** reference document ([DP_EKAMNET_COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE_v2.md](DP_EKAMNET_COGNITIVE_ARCHITECTURE_v2.md)). 

The review confirms that the v2.0 document succeeds in mapping the core structural layers (specifically the Theory $\rightarrow$ Proposition compilation boundary, the P1–P6 scientific validators, and the longitudinal belief lifecycle). However, to serve as an unambiguous canonical reference for future implementation, the architecture requires a clearer demarcation between current production capabilities and target milestone features, a more precise cognitive object inventory, and explicit definitions of its feedback loops.

The final evaluation verdict is:
```
READY_WITH_MINOR_REFINEMENTS
```

This review outlines the refinements required to graduate the architecture to its final canonical reference state.

## Current vs Target Audit

In the baseline v2.0 document, the **Current Production Architecture** (what is actually executed in the daily replay backtest today) and the **Target Architecture** (the future state after the completion of Milestones 8–10) are frequently blended.

### Identified Mixing Occurrences
1. **The Canonical Pipeline (Part 2)**: The pipeline sequence is presented as a single, fully integrated loop. In reality, the live backtest loop skips the Proposition Compiler, the P1–P6 validation gates, candidate competition, and belief lifecycles (which exist only inside the isolated `flows.minimal_learning_cycle` pilot sandbox).
2. **Subsystem Descriptions**: Components like the `Proposition Compiler`, `Closed Grammar`, and `Belief Memory` are described as fully operational parts of the cognitive loop, while they are actually stubs or synthetic-only prototypes in production.

### Recommendation for Clean Separation
Unify the presentation by splitting the pipeline visualization into two distinct loops:
* **The Current Production Loop**: Ingestion $\rightarrow$ Abstraction $\rightarrow$ Novelty Routing $\rightarrow$ Theory $\rightarrow$ Lineage $\rightarrow$ Experience $\rightarrow$ Lesson Extractor $\rightarrow$ Principle Engine $\rightarrow$ World Model $\rightarrow$ Prediction.
* **The Target Epistemic Loop**: Adds the Proposition Compiler, P1–P6 validators, MLC Competition Engine, and MLC Belief Memory at the compilation boundary.

## Cognitive Object Audit

Below is the canonical audit of all cognitive objects within the DP/EkamNet substrate:

| Object | Purpose | Producer | Consumer | Lifetime | Persistence | Current Status | Future Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Observation** | Raw daily market data | Ingestion Loop | AbstractionFlow | 1 Day | PostgreSQL | Production | Production |
| **Experience** | Historical correlation event | Replay Engine | LessonExtractor | Longitudinal | Local JSON | Production | Production |
| **Abstraction** | Semantic market representation | AbstractionFlow | Novelty Gate | 1 Day | PostgreSQL | Production | Production |
| **Theory** | LLM-derived causal narrative | TheoryGen | Lineage Engine | 1 Day | PostgreSQL / JSON | Production | Production |
| **Mechanism** | Semantic component of a theory | TheoryGen | MechanismEngine | Evolving | Local JSON | Production | Production |
| **Proposition** | Operational compiled claim | Prop. Compiler | Validation Gate | Evolving | SQL / JSON | Experimental | Target |
| **Evidence** | Attributed pass/fail outcomes | Validation | Belief Memory | Evolving | PostgreSQL | Production | Target |
| **Validation Record**| Causal comparison metrics | Validation | LessonExtractor | Longitudinal | PostgreSQL | Production | Production |
| **Belief** | Admitted proposition state | Belief Memory | World Model | Evolving | None (empty SQL) | Experimental | Target |
| **Lesson** | Generalized historical rule | LessonExtractor | TheoryGen context | Longitudinal | Local JSON | Production | Production |
| **Principle** | Stable validated mechanism | Invariant Engine | World Model | Longitudinal | Local JSON | Production | Production |
| **World Model** | Unified system narrative | WM Engine | TheoryGen context | Longitudinal | Local JSON | Production | Production |
| **Memory** | Historic regime analogs | Regime Memory | Novelty Gate | Longitudinal | In-memory | Production | Production |
| **Deferred Candidate**| Suspended proposition | Validation Gate | Re-entry Engine | Evolving | None (Stub) | Aspirational | Target |

*Note*: No core cognitive objects are missing from this inventory.

## Missing Layer Assessment

To ensure architectural simplicity and clear separation of concerns, the following layers are formally evaluated for inclusion:

1. **Mechanism Layer**: **KEEP**. This layer represents the vocabulary of causal tags (e.g., `MECH_001` - institutional accumulation) managed by the `MechanismEngine`. It must remain distinct from the **Theory Layer** (which represents LLM combinations of these tags) to allow tracking the age and stability of individual mechanisms independently of specific theories.
2. **Evidence Layer**: **KEEP**. This layer represents the historical contradiction and support statistics linked to active beliefs, separating raw validation results (observations) from the mathematical weight of evidence.
3. **Epistemic State Layer**: **KEEP**. This layer represents the longitudinal lifecycle states of propositions (Admitted, Weakened, Retired, Deferred). This state tracking is distinct from the raw **Memory Layer** (which retrieves historical analogs).
4. **Context Layer**: **RETIRE**. Context is not a distinct cognitive responsibility; it is the transient aggregation of observations, world models, and memory injected into the LLM prompt. Retiring it as a distinct layer reduces architectural bloat.

## Candidate F Placement

### Architectural Role
Candidate F is a **provenance-driven cognitive primitive** representing a targeted lineage history.

### Permanent Placement & Justification
Candidate F must reside permanently within the **Lineage Subsystem** managed by the `TheoryLineageEngine`.
* **Evidence**: In `run_counterfactual_experiment.py`, Candidate F's identity is defined by its stable lineage ID `5f33fb88966dd952`. 
* **Role**: It acts as the counterfactual control benchmark. When a mutation is triggered, the system suppression hooks target this specific lineage to evaluate intermediate routing shifts and cognitive convergence. Because it is tied to lineage-tree mutations, placing it in any other layer (such as routing or memory) would result in a category error.

## Knowledge Lifecycle Review

The proposed lifecycle flow is scientifically sound:
`Experience` $\rightarrow$ `Theory` $\rightarrow$ `Mechanism` $\rightarrow$ `Proposition` $\rightarrow$ `Evidence` $\rightarrow$ `Belief` $\rightarrow$ `Lesson` $\rightarrow$ `Principle` $\rightarrow$ `World Model`

### Justification of Transitions
1. `Experience` $\rightarrow$ `Theory`: LLMs generate theories based on semantic observation of past outcomes.
2. `Theory` $\rightarrow$ `Mechanism`: Theories decompose into modular, named mechanism components.
3. `Mechanism` $\rightarrow$ `Proposition`: Mechanisms are compiled into formal, operational propositions.
4. `Proposition` $\rightarrow$ `Evidence`: Propositions collect prospective validation passes and failures.
5. `Evidence` $\rightarrow$ `Belief`: Propositions backed by consistent positive evidence are admitted as beliefs.
6. `Belief` $\rightarrow$ `Lesson`: Beliefs are generalized over multiple experiences into lessons.
7. `Lesson` $\rightarrow$ `Principle`: Evolving lessons are consolidated into stable principles.
8. `Principle` $\rightarrow$ `World Model`: Principles are synthesized into a cohesive world model.

## Closed Cognitive Loop (Feedback Assessment)

To establish a true closed cognitive loop, the feedback pathways where knowledge influences future reasoning are formalized as follows:

```
               ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
               ▼                                      │
        Ingestion ──> TheoryGen ──> Validation ──> Memory/WM
               │                                      ▲
               └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **World Model $\rightarrow$ TheoryGen**: The synthesized `narrative_summary` and structured `explanatory_constraints` are injected into the Call 1 and Call 2 sequential extraction prompts. This constrains the LLM to only hypothesize mechanisms that align with verified physical market constraints.
2. **Lessons $\rightarrow$ TheoryGen (Revision)**: During `REVISE` operations, generalized lessons (rules about what triggers failed) are provided to the LLM mutation prompt, guiding it to prune or mutate specific mechanism components.
3. **Principles $\rightarrow$ Prediction (Deterministic Overrides)**: Stable principles containing active falsifiable predictions act as deterministic override filters. If a principle's trigger condition is met, the system bypasses the probabilistic LLM prediction in favor of the principle's expected direction.
4. **Memory $\rightarrow$ Ingestion/Abstraction**: Historical regime matches retrieved from memory are injected into the daily context, anchoring the LLM's current abstraction to historical analogies.

---

## Milestone Alignment

The baseline milestone roadmap requires one critical correction:
* **Proposition Compiler (Milestone 8) $\rightarrow$ trigger Pruning (Milestone 9) $\rightarrow$ Deferred Pool (Milestone 10)**

### Corrected Ordering Justification
1. **Milestone 8 (Generalized Proposition Compiler)** must occur first. You cannot defer or re-evaluate propositions until you can compile real-world continuous indicators (such as net flows or volume percentiles) instead of binary mocks.
2. **Milestone 9 (Context-Aware trigger Pruning)** must occur before Milestone 10 (Deferred Pool). Context-aware pruning is the safeguard that solves negative memory overgeneralization. Introducing deferred re-entry before solving overgeneralization would lead to immediate deferred starvation, as context shifts would lock up candidates before they could be evaluated for re-entry.

## Complexity Review (Simplicity Analysis)

The review identifies two areas of unnecessary complexity in the baseline v2.0 design:
1. **Regime Memory Redundancy**: `RegimeMemoryStore` (in-memory analog matching) and `RegimeContinuityMemory` (continuity tracking) share overlapping responsibilities.  
   * *Simplification*: Consolidate these into a single **RegimeMemoryManager** that handles both signature retrieval and continuity metrics updates.
2. **Nested Theory Schemas**: The distinction between `Theory` (outer container) and `TheoryStructured` (inner JSON) creates duplication in validation code.  
   * *Simplification*: Collapse these into a single unified `Theory` schema where the structured components are attributes rather than nested sub-objects.

---

## Long-Term Stability

DP/EkamNet v2.0 is structurally positioned for long-term stability:
* **LLM Agnostic**: The strict compilation boundary at the Theory $\rightarrow$ Proposition gate decouples natural language reasoning from machine verification. We can swap the LLM engine (e.g. from Ollama to proprietary models) without rewriting the validators or belief lifecycles.
* **Extensible Grammar**: The proposition grammar acts as an API. Adding new sensors or market indicators only requires registering the new tokens in the `OntologyRegistry` and updating the grammar validation rules, leaving the downstream competition and memory layers completely untouched.

---

## Final Verdict

```
READY_WITH_MINOR_REFINEMENTS
```

### Verdict Justification
The DP/EkamNet v2.0 architecture is logically sound, scientifically defensible, and successfully consolidates all recent research investigations. Graduating it to the canonical project reference requires resolving the mixed current-vs-target pipeline descriptions, consolidating duplicate regime memory classes, and implementing the corrected milestone ordering.
