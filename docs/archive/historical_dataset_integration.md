**Features:**
- Loads historical NIFTY CSV data
- Deterministic day-by-day navigation
- OHLCV + derived field exposure

day_data = engine.get_observation_for_day(0)
engine.log_entry(day_idx, date_str, obs_hash, theory_hash, conf_hash)
execution_hash = engine.finalize_execution()
```

---

### 4. ✓ Market Observation Synthesizer

**File:** [market/replay/market_observation_synthesizer.py](market/replay/market_observation_synthesizer.py)

**Deterministic Synthesis Rules:**

The synthesizer uses rule-based heuristics (no LLM) to generate observations:

#### Trend State
- **extended_higher**: +1% return over 2+ days
- **closed_higher**: +0.5% intraday close
- **extended_lower**: -1% return over 2+ days
- **closed_lower**: -0.5% intraday close
- **range_bound**: <0.3% intraday movement

#### Volatility State
- **expanded**: 30d volatility >2.0% or intraday range >1.5%
- **high**: 30d volatility 1.0-2.0%
- **moderate**: 30d volatility 0.5-1.0% or intraday range 0.8-1.0%
- **stable**: 30d volatility <1.0%
- **compressed**: <0.8% intraday range

#### Liquidity State
- **ample_with_strength**: volume_ratio >1.2 + positive return
- **ample_with_selling**: volume_ratio >1.2 + negative return
- **broad_participation**: volume_ratio 0.8-1.2 + directional move
- **even_flow**: volume_ratio 0.8-1.2 + neutral direction
- **concentrated_in_large_caps**: volume_ratio <0.8 + strong move
- **selective**: volume_ratio <0.8 + neutral move

#### Breadth State (5-day rolling)
- **strongly_participatory**: ≥80% up days
- **strengthened**: 60-80% up days
- **mixed**: 40-60% up days
- **weakened**: 20-40% up days
- **deteriorated**: <20% up days

#### Macro Sentiment
- **positive**: ≥2 positive indicators
- **risk_off**: ≥2 negative indicators
- **cautiously_positive**: 1 positive, 0 negative
- **uncertain**: 1 negative, 0 positive
- **neutral**: mixed indicators

#### Contradiction Markers
Auto-detected:
- `price_up_breadth_down`: Higher close + weak breadth
- `momentum_with_volatility_expansion`: Extended trend + expanded volatility
- `liquidity_concentration_weak_breadth`: Concentrated liquidity + weak breadth
- `range_bound_volatility_expansion`: Range-bound + expanded volatility

**Example Output:**
```python
MarketObservation(
    market_name="NIFTY 50",
    observation_text=(
        "NIFTY closed higher while volatility expanded but breadth weakened. "
        "Liquidity remained concentrated in large-caps."
    ),
    trend_state="closed_higher",
    volatility_state="expanded",
    liquidity_state="concentrated_in_large_caps",
    breadth_state="weakened",
    macro_sentiment="cautiously_positive",
    contradiction_markers=["price_up_breadth_down", "volatility_lift_on_strength"],
    observation_source="replay_engine_2023-01-02"
)
```

- Empirical confidence trajectory (initial → final → trend)
- Regime confidence tracking
- Theoretical coherence evolution
- Contradiction pressure dynamics

#### Contradiction Dynamics

**Usage:**
```python
from market.replay.replay_analysis import ReplayAnalysisEngine

## Determinism Verification

The replay system provides deterministic reproducibility:

```
Run 1 Hash: a005ed120ebe61b4...
Run 2 Hash: a005ed120ebe61b4...
Status: ✓ VERIFIED
```

**Why deterministic:**
1. Rule-based observation synthesis (no LLM randomness)
2. Deterministic hash computation (SHA256)
3. Chronological data ordering (ascending)
4. No stochastic sampling

## Runtime Safety

**Implemented safeguards:**
1. ✓ CSV file existence check before load
2. ✓ Graceful yfinance failure handling
3. ✓ NaN and duplicate detection in validator
4. ✓ Future date filtering
5. ✓ Minimum size threshold enforcement
6. ✓ MultiIndex column flattening for yfinance compatibility
7. ✓ Invalid replay range bounds checking

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Deterministic Over Adaptive
- Rule-based observation synthesis (not LLM-based)
- Ensures reproducibility across runs
- Focuses on studying cognition, not optimizing observations

### 2. Offline-First
- All data pre-downloaded and persisted
- No real-time market feeds
- Deterministic replay over historical data
- Safe for repeated experiments

### 3. Inspectable Rules
- All observation synthesis rules documented
- Clear thresholds for state transitions
- Human-readable observation text generation
- No black-box neural components

### 4. Integrity Preservation
- No temporal leakage (future data visible)
- Chronological ordering enforced
- Duplicate handling
- NaN detection and removal

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Observation Stagnation
**Problem:** Rule-based synthesis might be too deterministic, leading to repetitive observations.

**Mitigation:** Threshold variations across rolling windows (10d, 30d volatility) create natural diversity while maintaining determinism.

**Observation:** DAY 0 and DAY 828 both synthesize "range-bound" due to similar price action patterns, which is correct and expected.

### Risk: Overconfidence in Simplified Rules
**Problem:** Real market breadth is complex; our heuristics may oversimplify.

**Mitigation:**
- Heuristics based on well-known market structure patterns
- Clearly marked as synthetic observations
- Designed to test cognition resilience, not predict accurately
- Analysis engine will detect when cognition becomes too confident

### Risk: Regime Change Blindness
**Problem:** System might not adapt when market regime shifts.

**Mitigation:** Tracking macro_sentiment and regime_confidence metrics. Analysis will detect when coherence fails across regime boundaries.

- Deterministic replay validation
- Longitudinal cognition experiments
- Contradiction dynamics study
- Theory survival analysis
- Confidence evolution measurement

The system preserves the reflective cognition philosophy by prioritizing:
- **Inspectability** over optimization
